# Piwik Traffic Sources

## Description

This is a plugin for the Open Source Web Analytics platform Piwik. If enabled, it will add a new widget that you can add to your dashboard.

The widget will show you the actual traffic sources of a site. The widget auto-refreshes every x seconds. 

**This plugin should run fine with installations with up to 10.000.000 page impressions per day. If you run a very large piwik installation and have performance issues with this plugin, please contact me - there is a solution for this. I have it up and running in an installation with more than 15 million visits per day.**

(Tested with piwik 2.8.3, but supposed to run with older versions)

## Installation

Install it via Piwik Marketplace OR install manually:

1. Clone the plugin into the plugins directory of your Piwik installation.

   ```
   cd plugins/
   git clone https://github.com/chanzler/piwik-traffic-sources.git TrafficSources
   ```

2. Login as superuser into your Piwik installation and activate the plugin under Settings -> Plugins

3. You will now find the widget under the Live! section.
